# facebook clone
 This is just a dummy facebook that I deisgned to put my skill on check and I'm so eager to take on any design challenge.
 
# Description
 This is a look and feel replica of the original facebook designed with the most basic technologies HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT.
 
 I included some effects to make it more fun.
 Also the media responsiveness feature that makes it compatible on all platforms.
 Here is the link to the github page I deployed it [Dummy Facebook](https://sawlew.github.io/dummy/).
 
 Below is the walkthrough of what the design is like. Please your review and advice would be highly appreciated.
