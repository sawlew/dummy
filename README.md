# facebook clone
 This is just a dummy facebook that I deisgned to put my skill on check and I'm so eager to take on any design challenge.
 
# Description
 This is a look and feel replica of the original facebook designed with the most basic technologies HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT.
 I included some effects to make it more fun.
 Also the media responsiveness feature that makes it compatible on all platforms.
 
 Below is the walkthrough of what the design is like. Please your review and advice would be highly appreciated.
